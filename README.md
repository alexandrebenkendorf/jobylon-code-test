# Code Test

## Introduction
Hello there! 

This is a code assessment project developed by me for [Jobylon](https://www.jobylon.com/)

You might quick check the envision design on Figma [here](https://www.figma.com/file/0fFVbm1uapVQx2QCCxmVKO/Jobylon?node-id=0%3A1&t=810XiUUX1CVqIqVn-1)

And you might be thinking: "Did he clone their website?"

Well, I like their design and it was more than an inspiration for this project and since this project is a test for a job position there, why not keep the same look and feel?

Hope you enjoy it.

## Installation

This project is using `yarn` as the package manager. [Documentation](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install)

### 1 Step
If you already have it, you can skip to the *2 Step*

Just in case, please double check if you already have it, running:

```
yarn --version
```

Otherwise run

```
npm install --global yarn
```

### 2 Step

Open the project directory on the terminal and run

```
yarn 
```

Yep, that's all :)

## The fun part

Get the app up and running \o/
```
yarn start
```

It should open your browser automatically, but, again, just in case, please check, on your browser: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) 
> Btw I just tested it on Chrome, Safari and Firefox

Have fun!

## Tests

Use `yarn test` for a full unit test. You might add `--coverage` flag to check the coverage.

Obs: The tests are also using `jest-axe` to look for accessibility violations.
